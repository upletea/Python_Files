## Analysis
 
 *Break down the problem and look carefully at the details and data.*

**Scenario:** Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year. 

- How can you figure out which month raised the most money? 

   *Doing a survey and  recording the results in a column graph or bar graph would be an efficient strategy to have a visual representation of how much money was raised each month.*

- What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?

   *Get results of how much money was made monthly. Create a column or bar graph of each months profits showcasing the amount raised.* 

## Evaluation

*Think about how to compare information and decide what is best or most useful.*

**Scenario:** Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one). 

- How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular? 

   *Use a tally system for each of the field trips, one tally corressponding to one vote. Then put these results into a table to see which is a more popular option.*

- What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?
*The information that would be compared to confirm the elite choice would be the overall votes from the class for each option*

## Application

*Use what you know about data to solve a real-world problem or task.*

**Scenario:** You are planning a class party. 

- What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)? 

*Some vital data that could be utilised is a digital quiz, maybe a google foms, asking each member a numerous amount of questions.. It would include components such as mulitiple choice questions such as favourite pizza flavour, or soft drink preferences, as well as a question asking about allergies or dietary requirements*

- How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?

*Organising the multiple choice results in a table would be practical, while putting the individual diatary reqiurements next to the persons name.*

## Synthesis

*Combine pieces of information to form a complete picture or new idea.*

**Scenario:** Your teacher has one list of students with perfect attendance and another list of students with top grades. Both lists are names (text data). 

- How could you put these two lists together to find out which students are on both lists? 

   *To put the list together, a venn diagram could be used to systimatically find out who appears in both lists.*

- Why would it help to organise the names clearly (for example, alphabetically or in a table) when looking for students that appear in both sets of data?

   *It would be much more practical to use a venn diagram to find the students names as the diagram shows a clear crossover of names*

## Critical Thinking

*Question the data and think about whether it is fair, accurate, or useful.*

**Scenario:** Imagine a toy ad says, "90% of kids love this toy!" You find out they only asked 10 kids and 9 said they loved it (yes). 

- What might be wrong or unfair about this data?

   *This proclamation of "9/10 kids love this toy" is not reliabale as there was not enough data collected to back up this claim. There preferences, backgrounds, ages and cultures might not be properly accounted for, not showing a range of different opinions*

- What questions would you ask before believing the adâ€™s claim (for example, Is 10 kids a big enough sample? Did they ask a fair mix of different kids?)? 

   *Some questions that would need to be asked include: "How old are the children?", "what are their cultural backgrounds?" "what are their personal preferences?", "Did they have any bias?" "Was the data callected valid?*

- Explain why you would or wouldn't trust this claim based on the data.

   *I would not trust this claim as there was not enough diverse data collected nor enough people involved to confirm it.*

## Creative Thinking

*Use your imagination to solve a problem or improve something using data in a new way.*

**Scenario:** Imagine you want to get everyone to read more books by holding a fun contest at school. Think of a creative way to use data in this contest. For example, you could track how many pages or books each class reads (numbers) or have students vote for their favorite book (yes/no votes or a list of titles). 

- What data would you collect?
  
   *Data that should be collected includes: how many pages or books are read per student or per class and book ratings and reccomendations.*

- How would you use it to make the reading contest both fair and exciting?

   *I would use this data to put up the books most highly reccomended up somewhere for others to enjoy, as well as provide incentives for any classes/specific students with the most books or pages read in a certain time frame. One student in each class that has read the most per month could be presnted with an award at an assembly.*
