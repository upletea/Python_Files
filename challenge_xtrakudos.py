    "Freaky Forest": "Where the trees whisper your secrets, the mushrooms giggle when you step on them, and the raccoons organize weekly séances.",
    "Fabulous Farm": "Where the cows strut like runway models, the corn wears sequins, and every sunrise comes with a disco ball.",
    "Valiant Village": "Where every grandma wields a sword, the chickens patrol in armor, and the town meetings end with epic boss battles.",
    "Radical River": "Where the water surfs itself, the fish wear shades, and even the otters say 'cowabunga' before doing backflips off the rocks.",
    "Majestic Mountains": "Where the cliffs sing opera at dawn, snowflakes sparkle like glitter bombs, and yetis run a five-star hot cocoa spa.",
    "Curble's Campsite": "The only place where you might roast marshmallows, dodge flying raccoons, and accidentally ignite your sleeping bag—all before breakfast.",
    "Tasty Tower": "A dangerously delicious skyscraper where each floor is a new flavor, the elevators run on whipped cream, and one wrong bite could trigger a fondue flood."
